                <h2>Hello Welcome to my Portfolio Page</h2>

                <p>My passion has always been in computers and technology, I have always been curious about what makes things run and how I can make it better.</p>
                
                <p>Some skills that I have because of this curiosity is the ability to find and solve problems, how to use my rersources like GOOGLE or YouTube to learn how to fix or program devices, and my long history of retail and customer service has shown me where technology can improve all shopping and basic retail stores.</p>
