            <h2>Great Idea Project</h2>
            <img class="image-main" src="../images/great-idea.jpg" alt="Great Idea image" />
            <p>The Great Idea project was intended to tech us the basic use of html and css, were tasked with creating a .css file for the webpage using only Block and Inline grids in our code Flex Box was not allowed.</p>

            <p>This project gave me an understanding of the grid, box model, and css attributes,
                using these tools I was able to enhance the page through adjustments on padding, margins, border, and font styles just to name a few.

            <img class="image-main" src="../images/flex-box.jpg" alt="flex box image" />
            <p>In our Flex Box Project we learned how to intigrate flex box into our previous Great Idea webpage, allowing me to better adjust all the elements to fit evenly with there inherti elements.</p>

            <p>While working on this project I faced many challenges, such as writing more code than necessary or adding a display attribute to a child element instead of the parent element</p>

            <h2>User Interface Sprint Challange</h2>
            <img class="image-main" src="../images/user-interface.jpg" alt="user ineterface image" />
            <p>For our Sprint project we created a project called User Interface, in this project we combined our knowledge of html and css to edit boxes on a wesite already created, also adjusting the css of an about page to make it look like a real page with flex-box.</p>
            
            <p>Lambda school has allowed me to create amazing projects like these, due to imense amount of resources available to al of their students, so you can definately expect to see many more projects here.</p>
